SEO Notes & Next Steps for refurb360.in

Files added/updated locally:
- `index.html` — title/meta updated, LocalBusiness + Service JSON-LD added.
- `refurb.html` — ensure title/meta match domain when you deploy (you reverted earlier changes; run same updates if still needed).
- `best-drone-repair-coimbatore.html` — short local content page to boost local relevance.
- `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` — placed at project root.

Deploy checklist (Hostinger):
1) Upload all files to the Hostinger domain root for `refurb360.in`.
2) Enable HTTPS (Let's Encrypt) on Hostinger.
3) Visit https://refurb360.in/sitemap.xml to confirm accessibility.
4) Add and verify `https://refurb360.in/` in Google Search Console.
5) Submit the sitemap URL in Search Console and request indexing for / and /refurb.html and /best-drone-repair-coimbatore.html.
6) Create or claim Google Business Profile with the exact address/phone used in the JSON-LD.

Optional improvements I can do now:
- Add Service schema entries into `refurb.html` and `best-drone-repair-coimbatore.html`.
- Generate social preview image `assets/hero-bg.jpg` at absolute path so OG image resolves.
- Create a small robots-safe contact form test or sitemap index if more pages exist.

If you'd like, I can now re-run edits on `refurb.html` (you reverted it earlier) to match `index.html` exactly — say "update refurb.html" and I'll apply them.
